Welcome to scACCorDiON's documentation!
=====================================

we present scACCorDiON$$^{1,2}$$ (single-cell Analysis of Cell-Cell Communication in Disease clusters using Optimal transport
in Directed Networks), an optimal transport algorithm exploring node distances on the Markov Chain as the ground metric between
directed weighted graphs. Additionally, we derive a k-barycenter algorithm using the Wasserstein-based distance, which is able to
cluster directed weighted graphs. We compare our approach with competing methods in several large cohorts of scRNA-seq data. Our
results show that scACCorDiON can predict clusters better, matching the disease status of samples. Moreover, we show that barycenters
provide a robust and explainable representation of cell cell communication events related to the detected clusters. We also provide a case
study of pancreas adenocarcinoma, where scACCorDion detects a sub-cluster of disease samples associated with changes in the tumor
microenvironment.
